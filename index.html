    <h1>My brief personal introduction</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>I was a slave at the age of 6, working like a cow and trapped in the barn at night. In 1993, when I was 13, I was sold by a farmer to another farm. This time, the farmer was very kind to me, just like his own son. In 1995, when I was 15 years old, farmers helped me find my biological parents. I found them in 2006, when I was 26 years old and living well, and the former one had been arrested. I'm black, and white people hate black people the most, so there's nothing you can do. I don't think my life is good.But I really want to go to China. I didn't go to China until 2014 when I was 34 years old. In 2024, I was born in 1980, my father was born in 1948 and my mother was born in 1950. I don't know if America is racist. Didn't Lincoln do this at the time? Didn't he free the black slaves? He said the United States is a chaotic place and I should be careful. This is my story. There is one more important thing. In the United States, you can't go out at night, otherwise you will be.. I can't say this now, you will know on the inquiry.</p>
